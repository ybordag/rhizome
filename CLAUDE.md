# Rhizome — Claude Code Memory

## Branch
Active development is on `geranium`. `main` is behind — do not treat it as current or merge until intentionally reconciled.

## Build and test
```
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

/opt/miniconda3/envs/RHIZOME_ENV/bin/python -m pytest          # full suite (310 tests)
/opt/miniconda3/envs/RHIZOME_ENV/bin/python -m pytest -m unit        # fast unit tests
/opt/miniconda3/envs/RHIZOME_ENV/bin/python -m pytest -m integration # database-backed tests
/opt/miniconda3/envs/RHIZOME_ENV/bin/python -m pytest -m graph       # graph and orchestration tests
```
Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env` to run the CLI. Tests mock the model and run without a key.
Use the `RHIZOME_ENV` conda environment — never install into the base environment.

## Current state

**Phases 1–5 complete** (activity log, project planner, task tracker, operational triage + weather, structured interactions). The full **plan → task → triage → action → history** loop works in the CLI.

**API readiness work complete (geranium, 2026-06):**
- 93 tools (up from 72), all organized into `garden/`, `projects/`, `operations/` subdirs
- `Task.priority` field (`critical/high/normal/low`), auto-assigned at generation, user-overridable
- `get_daily_priority_tasks` — deterministic scoring across urgency, type, priority, triage alignment, blocking count
- `cascade_defer_to_dependents` — deferred task cascades earliest_start to direct dependents
- Gap-fill tools: `list_incidents`, `get_incident`, `get_project_proposal`, `get_project_progress`
- Bulk location assignment: `assign_beds_to_project`, `assign_containers_to_project`
- Status transition guards on `complete_task`, `skip_task`, `defer_task`
- `delete_project` blocked when active tasks exist (prevents orphan task rows)
- N+1 query fixes in `list_projects`, `get_project`, `search_garden`, `list_by_location`
- DB schema: user_id indexes on Plant/Bed/Container/PlantBatch, unique constraints on ProjectBed/ProjectContainer, ActivityEvent.revision_id FK
- Action history: `get_task_activity`, `get_incident_activity`, `list_project_activity`, enhanced `list_recent_activity` with DB-level filtering and cursor pagination; `interaction_resolved` events now recorded by `resolve_interaction_record`
- 310 tests, 0 failures; `tests/DEFERRED_TESTS.md` documents 11 consciously deferred areas

**Active work — Cambium (Go API gateway):**
- Cambium sits between Verdant (React frontend) and Rhizome
- Handles JWT auth, bcrypt password hashing, refresh token rotation
- Proxies all `/api/v1/*` to Rhizome's internal HTTP interface
- See `../cambium/CLAUDE.md` for Cambium's build plan and invariants

**Next in Rhizome:**
- Postgres migration (prerequisite for multi-instance deployment and FK enforcement)
- Multi-tenancy: thread `user_id` from JWT (via Cambium) into every tool query
- FastAPI layer for internal HTTP interface (Cambium → Rhizome)
- Model provider abstraction (Phase 2): env-var switch for Gemini / Claude / OpenAI / local endpoint

## Known issues
- `user_id == 1` hardcoded in ~15 files across `agent/core/nodes.py` and `agent/tools/` — Phase 1 work (multi-tenancy)
- `ActivityEvent.revision_id` FK is defined in the model but SQLite does not enforce it at runtime; enforcement lands with Postgres migration
- SQLite `ProjectBed`/`ProjectContainer` unique constraints are enforced by the DB for new inserts but cannot be added retroactively to an existing SQLite DB without a migration script

## Invariants — never violate
- **Model access only through `agent/core/model.py`.** Never instantiate a model client directly or at import time anywhere else.
- **No hardcoded user identity.** Never write `user_id == 1` or any literal user identity. User identity flows from `graph.config["configurable"]["user_id"]`.
- **Every DB query on user-owned data must be scoped to the owning user.** Filtering by entity `id` alone is a bug.
- **Untrusted content writes go through `interaction_node`.** Any tool writing data derived from external sources must create an interaction envelope and wait for user confirmation before persisting.
- **Never call `datetime.utcnow()`.** Use `datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)` for DB columns (naive UTC). For non-DB use, plain `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` is fine.
- **Status transition guards.** `complete_task`, `skip_task`, `defer_task` reject `done`/`superseded` targets. `start_task` rejects `done`/`skipped`/`superseded`. Do not bypass these guards.
- **`delete_project` requires no active tasks.** The tool blocks if non-superseded tasks exist. Use `update_project(status='complete')` for finished projects.
- **Tests required for every new feature.** `python -m pytest` must be green before any task is done.

## Postgres migration notes
`requirements.txt` includes `psycopg2-binary` and `pgvector`. When migrating:
- Swap `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` → `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` in requirements
- Update `db/database.py` engine and session factory
- LangGraph's Postgres checkpointer is a drop-in for SqliteSaver
- Run Postgres with streaming replication for HA (Patroni or pg_auto_failover)
- This migration is a prerequisite for multi-instance deployment and proper FK enforcement
